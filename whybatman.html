                  <p>
                     Batman operates in the fictional Gotham City wih assistance from various supporting
                     characters,including his butler Alfred, police commissioner Gordon, and vigilante allies
                     such as Robin. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers;rather,
                     he relies on his genius intellect, physical prowess, martial arts abilities, detective
                     skills, science and technology, vast wealth, intimidation, and indomitable will. A large 
                     assortment of villains make up Batmans's rogues gallery, including his archenemy, the Joker.

                   <h2>The One Man War On Crime</h2>
                  <p>
                     Although Batman now has a family of sorts comprised of Robin, Red Robin and Nightwing, among
                     others, his origin as a one-man war on crime is perhaps one of the most endearing aspects of 
                     his character. If you've ever been a victim of a criminal, then you'll be familiar with the 
                     sense of rageful injustice that comes hand in hand. Bruce Wayne, as early as 8 years old,
                     had suffered this injustice to such an extreme that he chose to arm himself with every
                     weapon possible and suit uo to take back the streets, one lowlife at a time.

                   <h2>The Bat Cave</h2>
                  <p>
                     It houses literally the entire Bat-legacy:from Batsuits to Batmobiles, as well as trophies
                     of victory and oh, who could forget, a giant T-Rex statue. In fact the Batcave is 
                     conceptually similar to Bruce Wayne himself in many ways; where there once was a dark,
                     endless void deep beneath the surface, now resides the Batman. There are plenty of physical
                     and metaphorical barriers that he places around himself and his secret identity, but the
                     Batcave is by far the most awesome.
